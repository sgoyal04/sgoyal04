# Hi, I'm Sanika Goyal! 👋

## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a full stack developer and Software Systems student at Simon Fraser University. I love building intuitive web applications and backend systems that are scalable, secure, and well-architected. While I’m currently focused on full stack development roles to gain practical industry experience, I’m also deeply curious about low-level systems, Rust programming, and distributed architectures.

## 👩‍💻 I'm currently working on  
- Developing full stack apps using React, Tailwind, and Spring Boot  
- Building and testing RESTful APIs backed by PostgreSQL 

## 🧠 I'm currently learning  
- Best practices in frontend/backend development for production apps  

## 👯‍♀️ I'm looking to collaborate on  
- Full stack projects with a strong backend or API component  
- Tools and research focused on systems, performance, or security  

## 🤔 I'm looking for help with
- Learning cloud deployment pipelines and CI/CD setups  

## 💬 Ask me about  
- Frontend stacks like React + Tailwind  
- Java and Spring Boot for backend development  
- Transitioning from user-facing work to software engineering
